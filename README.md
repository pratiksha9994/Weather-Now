 Title

Weather API Integration – Dynamic Weather Webpage


 Short Description

A responsive webpage that fetches and displays live weather data from a public API. The project demonstrates how to dynamically load, update, and present weather information using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.


 What It Does

* Uses fetch (or similar) to get current weather data for a user-specified location (city name or coordinates).
* Displays data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy), possibly an icon.
* Provides a “Refresh” or “Get Weather” button to re-fetch updated data.
* Layout is responsive — works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

 Tech Stack

Frontend:HTML, CSS (responsive design), JavaScript (for API calls and DOM manipulation)
Data Source: Public weather API ( Open-Meteo)
Optional:Possible use of free API key, asynchronous JavaScript functions, error handling

 Features

* Dynamic fetching & rendering of weather data
* Loading state / error messages when API request fails or is slow
* Responsive design so layout adjusts on different screen sizes
* Clean styling (card layout or similar) for readability



 Usage / How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the HTML file in browser *or* serve via a simple HTTP server (e.g. using `http-server` in Node)
3. Enter the location (if implemented) or use default location
4. Click “Get Weather” / Refresh button to fetch and display weather data



 Future Improvements (Optional / Roadmap)

* Add forecast (hourly / daily) in addition to current weather
* Allow user input for city / location, with suggestions or validation
* Improve UI with icons, backgrounds for different weather conditions
* Show additional data like UV index, sunrise/sunset, or air pressure
* Add caching or local storage to avoid repeated API calls for same location
* Add unit toggle (Celsius / Fahrenheit)
